A list of resources for learning how to use Cutlist plugin

# Introduction #

Here are a list of resources for learning how to use the Cutlist plugin. None were written by me and I have not scrutinized them a great deal. It represents how others have come to use the plugin and that's just fine, you may find the right method for you in one of these tutorials.

As Roy Underhill writes "Anyone willing to hew timbers on a hot day is pretty much entitled to proceed in his own damn way"


# Word and Picture Tutorials #

## Integration with CutListPlus ##
Joe Zeh of Swamp Road Woodworking shows how to link Cutlist and CutListPlus to create a nice workflow for cabinet shops. Design in Sketchup -> create Cutlist using Cutlist plugin -> export to CutListPlus -> use CutListPlus's excellent layout and costing functions.
This gives a very professional design to shop floor production workflow for very little cost and not just in theory, many shops are doing this.
